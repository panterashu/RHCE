E-MAIL

Postfix is the default mail server in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. 

Postfix is provided by the postfix RPM package. It is a modular program made up of several cooperating programs. 

Its components are controlled by the master process.

/etc/postfix/main.cf  main configuration file of the postfix mail server 

/etc/postfix/master   controls what subservices are started.

The configuration file /etc/postfix/main.cf can be edited in two ways: by hand using a text editor such as vim, or it can be 
edited using the postconf utility. 
The postconf command allows for querying by individual or all settings, modifying settings, querying defaults, 
or showing all settings that differ from the built-in defaults:

  Run the postconf command without any parameter to query all settings from the /etc/
postfix/main.cf configuration file

postconf

  Query a particular set of options by listing them after the postconf command, separated by
white space. Run the following to list the inet_interfaces and myorigin options with their
corresponding values

postconf inet_interfaces myorigin

If a value in /etc/postfix/main.cf starts with a dollar sign ($), it is not a literal
value, but instead points to the value of a different setting. In the previous example,
the myorigin setting will have the same value as the myhostname setting. Using
this syntax can simplify maintenance, since the value only has to be updated in one
place.

  Run the following to add new or change existing options in the /etc/postfix/main.cf configuration file: 
  postconf -e 'setting = value' 
  If there was already a setting by that name in the configuration file, it will be updated to the new value; otherwise, it will be added to
the bottom of the configuration file.

The postfix service requires a reload or restart after the changes have been made to /etc/postfix/main.cf.

When troubleshooting email, a log of all mail-related operations is kept in the systemd journal and /var/log/maillog, 
which includes information of any mail serverrelated actions.

The postqueue -p command displays a list of any outgoing mail messages that have been queued. 
To attempt to deliver all queued messages again immediately, run the postqueue -f command; 
otherwise, Postfix will attempt to resend them about once an hour until they are accepted or expire.

Configure the Postfix mail server on serverX.example.com as a null client which relays mail through 
smtpX.example.com, using desktopX.example.com as your organization's domain name on outgoing email

postconf -e "relayhost=[smtpX.example.com]"
postconf -e "inet_interfaces=loopback-only"
postconf -e "mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128"
postconf -e "myorigin=desktopX.example.com"
postconf -e "mydestination="
postconf -e "local_transport=error: local delivery disabled"
systemctl restart postfix
mail -s "serverX null client" student@desktopX.example.com null client test
mutt -f imaps://imapX.example.com
