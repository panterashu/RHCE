Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 implements network teaming with a small kernel driver and a userspace
daemon, teamd. The kernel handles network packets efficiently and teamd handles logic
and interface processing. Software, called runners, implement load balancing and active-backup
logic, such as roundrobin. The following runners are available to teamd:

• broadcast: a simple runner which transmits each packet from all ports.
• roundrobin: a simple runner which transmits packets in a round-robin fashing from each of
the ports.
• activebackup: this is a failover runner which watches for link changes and selects an active
port for data transfers.
• loadbalance: this runner monitors traffic and uses a hash function to try to reach a perfect
balance when selecting ports for packet transmission.
• lacp: implements the 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol. Can use the same transmit
port selection possibilities as the loadbalance runner
