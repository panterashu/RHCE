MariaDB


install
yum groupinstall mariadb mariadb-client

main config file
/etc/my.cnf
Instead of adding new configurations to the /etc/my.cnf file, a newly created file named *.cnf can be added to the 
/etc/my.cnf.d/ directory holding the configuration of MariaDB.

systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb

Verify that MariaDB is listening on all interfaces:
ss -tulpn | grep mysql (3306 port)

systemctl status mariadb

mysql_secure_installation

MariaDB network configuration directives are found in the /etc/my.cnf file, under the [mysqld] section.
- bind-address (The server will listen based on this directive.)
- skip-networking (If set to 1, the server will listen only for local clients.)
- port (Port to listen on for TCP/IP connections.)

For remote access, the firewall needs to be modified. Fortunately, it is a known service, so it can be simply added via:

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql
firewall-cmd --reload
