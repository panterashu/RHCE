MariaDB

cum se instaleaza
yum groupinstall mariadb mariadb-client

main config file
/etc/my.cnf
Instead of adding new configurations to the /etc/my.cnf file, a newly created file named *.cnf can be added to the 
/etc/my.cnf.d/ directory holding the configuration of MariaDB.

systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb

Verify that MariaDB is listening on all interfaces:
ss -tulpn | grep mysql (3306 port)

systemctl status mariadb

Set root password? [Y/n] Y
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y

MariaDB network configuration directives are found in the /etc/my.cnf file, under the [mysqld] section.
- bind-address (The server will listen based on this directive.)
- skip-networking (If set to 1, the server will listen only for local clients. skip-networking=1)
- port (Port to listen on for TCP/IP connections.)

For remote access, the firewall needs to be modified. Fortunately, it is a known service, so it can be simply added via:

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql
firewall-cmd --reload

list the databases
SHOW DATABASES;

To create a new database
CREATE DATABASE inventory;

After the creation of the new database, the next step is to connect to this database:
USE inventory;

List the tables:
SHOW TABLES;

To list attributes (or the column names) from a table, use:
DESCRIBE servers;

These four basic commands are often referred to by the generic term "CRUD operations." 
CRUD stands for Create (insert), Read (select), Update (update), and Delete (delete).

#insert#

DESCRIBE product; - ca sa vezi ce structura are tabelul product si ce fel de date poti sa introduci

INSERT INTO product (name,price,stock,id_category,id_manufacturer) VALUES ('SDSSDP-128G-G25 2.5',82.04,30,3,1);

Table name.
Attributes (columns) that will be inserted.
Values that will be inserted in the same order defined by attributes, using the proper data types.

#delete#
DELETE FROM product WHERE id = 1;

Table name.
Clause that imposes a condition on the command execution.
The condition for the record to be deleted; often the primary key-value pair is used.

If the where clause is not specified, all records in the table will be erased. This is the database equivalent of running 
rm -rf /.

#update#

UPDATE product SET price=89.90, stock=60 WHERE id = 5;

Table name.
Define the new value from specified attributes.
Clause that imposes a condition on the command execution.
The condition for the record to be updated.

If the where clause is not specified, all records will be updated

#select#

SELECT name,price,stock FROM product ;

Attributes that will be selected.
Table name.

To select all attributes, use the wild card *:
SELECT * FROM product;

Filter results with the where clause:
SELECT * FROM product WHERE price > 100;

Common Operators for where Clauses
Operator Description

=   Equal
<>  Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL, this operator may be written as !=
>   Greater than
<   Less than
>=  Greater than or equal
<=  Less than or equal
BETWEEN   Between an inclusive range
LIKE  Search for a pattern
IN  To specify multiple possible values for a column
