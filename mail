E-MAIL

Postfix is the default mail server in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. 

Postfix is provided by the postfix RPM package. It is a modular program made up of several cooperating programs. 

Its components are controlled by the master process.

/etc/postfix/main.cf  main configuration file of the postfix mail server 

/etc/postfix/master   controls what subservices are started.

The configuration file /etc/postfix/main.cf can be edited in two ways: by hand using a text editor such as vim, or it can be 
edited using the postconf utility. 
The postconf command allows for querying by individual or all settings, modifying settings, querying defaults, 
or showing all settings that differ from the built-in defaults:

  Run the postconf command without any parameter to query all settings from the /etc/
postfix/main.cf configuration file

postconf

  Query a particular set of options by listing them after the postconf command, separated by
white space. Run the following to list the inet_interfaces and myorigin options with their
corresponding values

postconf inet_interfaces myorigin

If a value in /etc/postfix/main.cf starts with a dollar sign ($), it is not a literal
value, but instead points to the value of a different setting. In the previous example,
the myorigin setting will have the same value as the myhostname setting. Using
this syntax can simplify maintenance, since the value only has to be updated in one
place.

  Run the following to add new or change existing options in the /etc/postfix/main.cf
configuration file: postconf -e 'setting = value' If there was already a setting by that
name in the configuration file, it will be updated to the new value; otherwise, it will be added to
the bottom of the configuration file.

The postfix service requires a reload or restart after the changes have been made to /etc/postfix/main.cf.
