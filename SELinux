SELinux

Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an additional layer of system security.

SELinux is a set of security rules that determine which process can access which files, directories, and ports. 
Every file, process, directory, and port has a special security label called a SELinux context.

A context is a name that is used by the SELinux policy to determine whether a process can access a file, directory, or port. 
By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless an explicit rule grants access. If there is no allow rule, 
no access is allowed.

SELinux labels have several contexts: user, role, type, and sensitivity.

Many commands that deal with files have an option (usually -Z) to display or set SELinux contexts. 
For instance, ps, ls, cp, and mkdir all use the -Z option to display or set SELinux contexts.
